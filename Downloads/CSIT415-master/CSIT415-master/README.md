HOW TO OPEN THIS PROJECT:
1. Download all files. This can be done by clicking on "Code" in GitHub and then "Download Zip".
2. Make sure Node and npm are installed. 
    -To check, enter the terminal and type "node --version" and "npm --version". If you get some version, you should be fine.
    -If you are having issues with opening the site locally, you may need to update these!
3. Install Vite. This is a React Framework that we are building in.
    -Run "npm install -D vite"
4. Now cd to the root folder of the project. 
    -This should be accomplished by "cd course-scheduler" UNLESS you moved the folder from your User directory. In that case, cd to the full path name until you get to ".../course-scheduler"
5. Run these commands:
    -"npm install"
    -"npm run dev"
6. This will make "http://localhost:5173/" pop up in the terminal. Ctrl+click to go (or just type in the link in your browser) and you will see the interactive site. Any changes to the code will update the site dynamically AFTER you save.
